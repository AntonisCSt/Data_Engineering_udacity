# Hi!

# Welcome to my Data modeling and Postgresql ETL mini-project!

## In this project we are creating a relational star-shape database for sparkify

## What is spakrify?

#### """Sparkify is a start-up that wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app."""

#### So you will ask....
#### Ok Antonis, how do I create the database?

#### Well its easy!

##### 1) Feel free to check out the documentation its easy :)

##### 2) Go to test.ipynb run the first cell!

##### 3) go to erl.ipynb and run the last cell!

##### 4) go to the test.ipynb and run the rest of the test (if you want to redoo things please stop all kernels and go to 2) )




### Code Description:

In addition to the data files, the project workspace includes six files:

test.ipynb displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.

create_tables.py drops and creates your tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.

etl.ipynb reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.

etl.py reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. You can fill this out based on your work in the ETL notebook.

sql_queries.py contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
README.md provides discussion on your project.

testing_code.ipynb contains test code that was created during developement.
